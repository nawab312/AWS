Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed, in-memory caching service that improves application performance by reducing database load and latency. It supports Memcached and Redis, allowing fast data retrieval for real-time applications. ElastiCache automatically handles scaling, patching, and maintenance, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. It is commonly used for caching frequently accessed data, session storage, and real-time analytics.

### Scenario 1 ###
Your company runs a high-traffic e-commerce website, and you are using Amazon RDS for storing product details and user order history. The website has been experiencing high read latency during flash sales, especially when fetching product details. How would you use Amazon ElastiCache to improve the performance of your application, and what caching strategy would you implement?
- Which ElastiCache engine (Redis or Memcached) would you choose and why?
- How would you handle cache invalidation when product details are updated?
- What caching pattern would you useâ€”Lazy Loading, Write-Through, or Cache-aside?
- How would you ensure high availability and fault tolerance for ElastiCache?

**Step 1: Choosing the Right ElastiCache Engine**
Redis is the preferred choice over Memcached because:
- **Persistence:** Redis supports snapshotting and backups, which ensures data is not lost in case of failures.
- **Advanced Data Structures:** It allows us to store product details in efficient formats like Hashes, Sorted Sets, and Lists.
- **Replication & High Availability:** Redis offers Multi-AZ with automatic failover, ensuring reliability during high traffic events.

**Step 2: Caching Strategy**
We will use the **Cache-Aside** Pattern because:
- The application will first check the cache for product details.
- If data is not in the cache, it will fetch from RDS, update ElastiCache, and return thImplement Data Sharding if dataset size is large.e data to the user.
- If data is in the cache, it is returned immediately, reducing database queries.

**Step 3: Handling Cache Invalidation**
Since product details can change (e.g., price updates, stock availability), we must ensure cache consistency:
- **Time-To-Live (TTL):** Set an expiration time (e.g., 10 minutes) to refresh stale data.
- **Event-based Invalidation:** When a product is updated in RDS, use AWS Lambda to invalidate the cache entry.
- **Versioning:** Store a version ID in Redis and update it when data changes.

**Step 4: Ensuring High Availability & Fault Tolerance**
- Enable Multi-AZ & Auto Failover in Redis.
- Use Read Replicas to distribute read traffic.
- Monitor Cache Performance using Amazon CloudWatch and set alerts.
- Implement Data Sharding if dataset size is large.
