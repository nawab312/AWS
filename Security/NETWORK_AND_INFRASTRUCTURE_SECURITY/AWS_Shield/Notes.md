AWS Shield is a managed AWS Cloud service for DDoS protection against all known infrastructure (layer 3 and 4) attacks.

**AWS Shield Standard**
- AWS Shield Standard is free, and it offers DDoS protection against some of the more common layer 3, the network layer, and layer 4, the transport layer, DDoS attacks.
- This protection is applied automatically and transparently to your Elastic Load Balancers, Amazon CloudFront distributions, and Amazon Route 53

**AWS Shield Advanced**
- Shield Advanced also provides additional detection and mitigation against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks and near real-time visibility into attacks

*The difference between them is that AWS WAF(Web Application Firewall) provides protection on the application layer and AWS Shield protects the infrastructure layers of the OSI model*
