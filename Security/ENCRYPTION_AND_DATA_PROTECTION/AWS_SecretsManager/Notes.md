AWS Secrets Manager is a fully managed service that securely stores, manages, and retrieves sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and passwords. It automatically rotates secrets, eliminating the need for hardcoding credentials in applications. Secrets Manager integrates with AWS services like RDS, Lambda, and EC2, providing fine-grained access control using IAM policies. It also enables auditing and monitoring of secret access through AWS CloudTrail.
