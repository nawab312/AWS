AWS Macie is a fully managed data security and privacy service that uses machine learning to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data stored in Amazon S3

**Key Features**
- Sensitive Data Discovery – Identifies PII (Personally Identifiable Information), financial data, credentials, etc.
- Automated Data Classification – Uses ML and pattern matching to detect sensitive data.
- Continuous Monitoring – Scans S3 buckets for public access, encryption issues, and security risks.
- Alerts & Findings – Generates Security Hub-compatible alerts for risky data exposure.
- Multi-Account Support – Works across AWS Organizations for centralized security.

**How Macie Works?**
- Scans S3 Buckets – Detects unencrypted data, publicly accessible buckets, and sensitive files.
- Classifies Data – Uses predefined and custom data identifiers (e.g., credit cards, SSNs).
- Generates Findings – Sends alerts to Security Hub, EventBridge, or CloudWatch for response.
- Automates Remediation – Can trigger AWS Lambda to encrypt, move, or block sensitive data.
