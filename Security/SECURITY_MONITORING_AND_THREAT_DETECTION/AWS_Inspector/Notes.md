AWS Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that helps identify security issues in EC2 instances, container images in Amazon ECR, and AWS Lambda functions. 
It continuously scans workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

*Example Scenario: AWS Inspector in Action*

A company hosts a web application on Amazon EC2 instances and runs microservices in AWS Lambda and containers stored in Amazon ECR. The security team wants to ensure that:
- EC2 instances do not have outdated or vulnerable software.
- Container images in ECR are free from known vulnerabilities before deployment.
- AWS Lambda functions do not have security risks in their dependencies.

Step-by-Step Implementation

Step 1: Enabling AWS Inspector
- Go to the AWS Inspector console.
- Click on "Activate Inspector" â€“ This allows Inspector to automatically discover EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and container images in ECR.

Step 2: Resource Discovery
- AWS Inspector automatically identifies the following resources in the AWS account:
  - EC2 instances that have AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Agent installed.
  - Container images in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
  - AWS Lambda functions.
 
Step 3: Performing Vulnerability Scans
- AWS Inspector starts scanning the discovered resources against a database of known vulnerabilities (CVEs).
- It evaluates security risks such as outdated software versions, exposed network ports, and vulnerable dependencies.

Step 4: Reviewing Findings
- After scanning, AWS Inspector generates security reports with severity levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low.
- Example Findings:
  - EC2 Instance: Vulnerability found in OpenSSL (CVE-2022-1234).
  - ECR Container Image: Python package has a security issue (CVE-2023-5678).
  - Lambda Function: Uses an outdated requests library with a security flaw.
 
Step 5: Continuous Monitoring
- AWS Inspector continuously scans the resources and updates security findings.
- It integrates with AWS Security Hub and Amazon EventBridge to trigger alerts and automate responses.
