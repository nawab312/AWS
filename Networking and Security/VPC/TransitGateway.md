AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) is a highly scalable and flexible service that acts as a hub to connect multiple Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), on-premises networks, and even other AWS services in a centralized manner.

**Centralized Connectivity:**
- Instead of setting up individual peering connections between VPCs, you can use a **single Transit Gateway** to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks. This reduces the complexity of managing a mesh network of VPC peers
- AWS Transit Gateway supports **inter-region peering**, which allows you to connect VPCs across different AWS regions.
- Transit Gateway acts as a router and manages the routing of traffic between VPCs, on-premises networks, and other services. You can easily control the flow of traffic with routing tables for each connection, rather than managing routes on a per-VPC basis. It supports **route propagation** (automatic updates to routing tables)
- It supports a wide range of **attachments**, such as:
  - VPC attachments
  - VPN connections (to connect your on-premises network to AWS)
  - AWS Direct Connect (for high-performance, low-latency connections to your on-premises network)

 ### How AWS Transit Gateway Works: ###
 - **Attachments:** You create a Transit Gateway and attach VPCs, VPNs, or Direct Connect connections to it. This acts as a "hub" where all the traffic flows.
 - **Routing:** Each attachment has its own routing table. You can configure the routing tables to define how traffic flows between the connected networks. For example, you can define that VPC-A can communicate with VPC-B but not with VPC-C.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Multi-VPC Architectures:** Connecting multiple VPCs across different regions or accounts in a large organization.
  - **Hybrid Cloud Architectures:** Connecting on-premises networks to multiple VPCs using VPN or Direct Connect.
