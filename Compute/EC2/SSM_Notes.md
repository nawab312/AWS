Amazon SSM (AWS Systems Manager) is a service that lets you manage, automate, and securely access your EC2 and on-premises servers without needing SSH or bastion hosts. It provides features like remote command execution, patching, configuration management, and secure session access using IAM controls.

SSM uses a secure, *outbound HTTPS connection* initiated by the SSM Agent on the instance. This is fundamentally different from SSH or traditional client-server models.

**Why This Is Secure & Useful**
- No Inbound Rules Needed
  - Since the SSM Agent initiates communication, your instances donâ€™t need:
    - Public IP addresses
    - Open SSH ports (port 22)
    - Bastion hosts
- Can Work in Private Subnets
  - Even if your EC2 instance is in a private subnet with no internet access, SSM still works if:
    - You have a NAT Gateway or
    - You use VPC Endpoints for SSM
